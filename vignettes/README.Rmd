Communication is arguably the most cohesive force within a team. By exchanging information, team members build relationships, establish roles, and achieve goals. It is vital for and closely linked with productivity [@Dutta2021]. Yet, communication can also have unintended negative effects, sometimes even reducing team performance. This can result from issues like...

-   Coordination issues, such as:
    -   Challenges in building quality relationships
    -   Distractions from unrelated communication;
-   Motivational issues, such as:
    -   Reduced individual recognition as attention is divided
    -   Goal ambiguity when too many people are involved in decisions
    -   Decreased visibility of free-riding behaviour.

These types of issues are commonly described as the [Ringelmann Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringelmann_effect) [@Kravitz1986], where overall group performance ends up being less than the sum of individual contributions.

A simple [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app helps illustrate how adding people to a team can affect its performance. This quantitative perspective, inspired by @Brooks1995 and other sources, highlights where misunderstandings about team performance often begin. Many ask, "How many people do I need to...?" assuming that adding people is as simple as stacking Lego™ bricks.

**Explore this app's simulation to see how focusing only on team size can be misleading.**

The app's code is available [here](https://github.com/SigurdJanson/CommunicationOverload) on [GitHub](https://github.com), and a [live-version of the app on shinyapps.io](https://js-rapps.shinyapps.io/communicationoverload/).

## Overview of the App

Below is a screenshot of the app interface: [![Screenshot of the App](./vignettes/img/TeamCommunication_Overview.png)](https://js-rapps.shinyapps.io/communicationoverload/)

The **top panel** illustrates [Brooks' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law), showing the increasing number of relationships a team must maintain as its size grows. According to Brooks' Law, the number of relationships `R` is calculated as

$$ R = \frac{M * (M-1)}{2} $$ where `M` is the number of team members. The chart visualizes this: each dot represents a team member linked to all other members.

The **bottom panel** simulates potential negative effects of increasing team size. Contrary to expectations, adding more members may decrease overall performance. Adjust the slider to explore this dynamic.

**Choosing the Right Numbers**. This simulation's purpose is not to find an exact team size but to explore a range and understand performance shifts. Consider these findings for context:

-   In one study, @Elsayed-Elkhouly1997 found that executives spend about 30% of their time in meetings, with 35% of that time considered "wasted." This translates to roughly 10% wasted time overall---a factor to consider in any team.

-   In a scrum process, recommended scrum meeting times amount to `r ((20*0.25 + 1*8 + 0.5*8 + 3) )/(20*8) * 100`--`r ((20*0.25 + 1*8 + 0.5*8 + 3 + 16) )/(20*8) * 100`% of working hours (including refinement meetings) [@Overeem2018; @Schwaber2020]. However, real usage may be lower, as planning and refinement often serve productive purposes besides planning.

-   Recommendations for team size in software projects generally fall between 5--9 members. @Olivares2024 suggest 5--9, while @Rodriguez2012 notes performance declines when team size exceeds 9. Assuming this guideline optimizes for peak performance, then % lost would be estimated at 12--24%, with peak productivity typically seen at 5--9 members.

## Interpreting the Simulation

This app provides a simplified way to explore the relationship between team size and performance, offering insights that can raise awareness on the topic:

> There is no linear relationship between team size and output.

Team performance does not simply grow with each new member added. In fact, there may be a tipping point where adding another member even decreases overall performance.

**Limitations**. Brooks' Law and the simulation cannot predict specific outcomes for every team. Even @Brooks1995 cautioned that this model is "outrageously simplified" [@Brooks1995, chapter 19]. Team performance involves complex interactions and cannot be captured in precise figures. Even if we were able to quantify each of the numerous variables (which we never can) the relationships between those variables are complex and convoluted. However, by examining team dynamics closely, we can draw valuable insights for decision-making and identify best practices in team management. Continue reading.


## How Productive Is My Team?

Team dynamics vary widely, so the simulation above is designed to illustrate principles rather than to make precise predictions. Team performance is influenced by many factors beyond size, and it's essential to consider not only the volume of output but also its quality.

**Beyond time**. Time is a key productivity factor but far from the only one. Other critical factors include work speed, trust among team members [@DeJong2016], clear role definitions, diversity [@Haas2016], task type and dependencies [@Littlepage1991], degree of specialization of members, or their experience.

**Unproductive ≠ wasted time**. In any team, not all unproductive time is wasted time.

a.  Teams need time to establish and maintain social connections, routines, and ground rules, which indirectly support productivity. For instance, Scrum retrospective meetings aim to address obstacles, improve quality, and eliminate inefficiencies. While not directly contributing to output, this "unproductive" time is necessary for long-term performance; neglecting it risks stagnation or decline.

b.  Then there is wasted time---avoidable and unhelpful. Examples include inviting team members to irrelevant meetings, over-engineering solutions, or holding lengthy department updates with little relevance to attendees. Simple steps can reduce wasted time, like addressing meeting lateness, which was found to affect a third of meetings in a study by @Rogelberg2013. Identifying wasted time can be as easy as gathering input from team members, as even small changes can significantly improve efficiency.

**Recovery speed**. Teams benefit immensely from a strong recovery capacity after mistakes. Quick error identification and resolution are essential; the longer a mistake goes unaddressed, the greater the negative impact on productivity.

**N-wise**. Brooks' Law simplifies team dynamics as pairs, but in practice, team communication can include multiple members. For instance, Tom, Deborah, and Maria could resolve an issue in a single group conversation rather than through a series of pairwise exchanges. While group discussions might take longer than one-on-one chats, they're often faster overall, especially when decisions are needed. Knowing when to use pairwise versus group discussions is critical to avoiding "ping-pong" communication loops and keeping decision-making efficient. In my experience most people know intuitively how to choose.

**Quality**. A quantitative perspective alone doesn’t capture the quality of communication within a team. Effective communication, as defined by @Marlow2018, involves the timely sharing of critical and relevant information, ensuring that every team member is informed and empowered to make decisions. High-quality communication is essential to performance; quantity alone is ineffective without quality [@Mueller2012; @Marlow2018]. While numbers matter, they only add value if quality is prioritized.

**Change**. Changes in team composition can disrupt performance, often causing temporary setbacks or, in some cases, long-term decreases in efficiency. Even short absences require other team members to adapt, impacting productivity until the team adjusts.


Despite these limitations, Brooks’ Law provides valuable insights. In fact, taken together, law plus limitations can be applied as a practical tool for improving team performance. The next section outlines some principles that can help do just that. 



## Turning Limitations into a Tool

Combining insights from @Haas2016 with the findings discussed here, we can use a set of practical questions to help teams assess their potential and identify areas for improvement. The following points provide a foundation for building and evaluating team effectiveness.

**Clear and compelling direction**

- Does the team have a shared goal that is well-defined and motivating? Is it challenging enough to inspire without being out of reach?
- Is the goal significant for others outside the team?


**Strong structure**

- Does the team bring a diverse, complementary skill set?
- Is the team kept as small as possible to optimize communication and efficiency?
- Are team members individually accountable for completing their tasks?
- Are clear norms in place to guide expected behaviour and accountability?


**Supportive environment**

- Are essential resources, information, and training readily available?
- Is there dedicated time and space for team-wide information sharing?
- Is there a separate time for “going meta,” allowing members to reflect on team processes and identify improvements?
- Are meaningful rewards or recognition provided for team achievements?
- Does the team invest time to integrate new members, aligning them with the team's goals, roles, and processes?


**Unified mindset**

- Do team members feel a strong, shared identity and sense of belonging?
- Is information easily and openly shared within the team?
- Is there mutual understanding and respect for each member’s unique limitations and circumstances?



## Summary

Achieving strong team performance is not simply about adding members or increasing communication frequency; it requires a thoughtful balance of team structure and meaningful communication practices. While this discussion has focused on core aspects of team dynamics, other critical factors also shape performance. In recent years, psychological safety has gained attention as it emphasizes the need for open and honest communication—encouraging team members to share without withholding vital information [e.g. @ODonovan2020]. This foundation of trust is essential for resilience, equipping teams with the flexibility to adapt to shifting tasks, project phases, and team dynamics. These topics deserve in-depth exploration on their own.

Tools and simulations, like those featured in this article, offer valuable insights, yet successful teams are ultimately built on intentional, people-centered practices. By cultivating these principles, teams can effectively manage the complexities of collaboration, transforming challenges into opportunities for sustained, high-quality performance.

Quality over quantity

5.  As outlined above, some unproductive time is required to boost productivity in the remaining time. Do not remove everything that does not directly support productivity. A team needs to maintain itself.

Self-organising teams may need more time. In self-organisation some aspects that make the team are left to the team to work out by itself. That takes time. The idea is that self-organisation can lead to more effective team *in the long run*. Such teams are not necessarily more effective in the short run and not necessarily more efficient. At least Scrum tends to prioritise quality over quantity. [###LIT###TODO]

The most important pointer that I can give you is your team colleagues' satisfaction on the job. If you want to know about inefficiencies, just talk to them.

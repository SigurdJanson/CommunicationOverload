Communication is arguably the most cohesive force within a team. By exchanging information, team members build relationships, establish roles, and achieve goals. Yet, communication can also have unintended negative effects, sometimes reducing team performance. This can result from issues like...


-   Coordination issues, such as:
    -   Challenges in building quality relationships
    -   Distractions from unrelated communication;
-   Motivational issues, such as:
    -   Reduced individual recognition as attention is divided
    - Goal ambiguity when too many people are involved in decisions
    - Decreased visibility of free-riding behaviour.

These types of issues are commonly described as the [Ringelmann Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringelmann_effect) [@Kravitz1986], where overall group performance ends up being less than the sum of individual contributions.

A simple [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app helps illustrate how adding people to a team can affect its performance. This quantitative perspective, inspired by @Brooks1995 and other sources, highlights where misunderstandings about team performance often begin. Many ask, "How many people do I need to...?" assuming that adding people is as simple as stacking Lego™ bricks.

**Explore this app’s simulation to see how focusing only on team size can be misleading.**

The app's code is available [here](https://github.com/SigurdJanson/CommunicationOverload) on [GitHub](https://github.com), and a [live-version of the app on shinyapps.io](https://js-rapps.shinyapps.io/communicationoverload/).



## Overview of the App

Below is a screenshot of the app interface: [![Screenshot of the App](./vignettes/img/TeamCommunication_Overview.png)](https://js-rapps.shinyapps.io/communicationoverload/)

The **top panel** illustrates [Brooks' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law), showing the increasing number of relationships a team must maintain as its size grows. According to Brooks’ Law, the number of relationships `R` is calculated as 

$$ R = \frac{M * (M-1)}{2} $$ where `M` is the number of team members. The chart visualizes this: each dot represents a team member linked to all other members.

The **bottom panel** simulates potential negative effects of increasing team size. Contrary to expectations, adding more members may decrease overall performance. Adjust the slider to explore this dynamic.

**Choosing the Right Numbers**. This simulation’s purpose is not to find an exact team size but to explore a range and understand performance shifts. Consider these findings for context:

- In one study, @Elsayed-Elkhouly1997 found that executives spend about 30% of their time in meetings, with 35% of that time considered “wasted.” This translates to roughly 10% wasted time overall—a factor to consider in any team.

- In a scrum process, recommended scrum meeting times amount to `r ((20*0.25 + 1*8 + 0.5*8 + 3) )/(20*8) * 100`–`r ((20*0.25 + 1*8 + 0.5*8 + 3 + 16) )/(20*8) * 100`% of working hours (including refinement meetings) [@Overeem2018; @Schwaber2020]. However, real usage may be lower, as planning and refinement often serve productive purposes besides planning.

- Recommendations for team size in software projects generally fall between 5–9 members. @Olivares2024 suggest 5–9, while @Rodriguez2012 notes performance declines when team size exceeds 9. Assuming this guideline optimizes for peak performance, then % lost would be estimated at 12–24%, with peak productivity typically seen at 5–9 members.



## Interpreting the Simulation

This app provides a simplified way to explore the relationship between team size and performance, offering insights that can raise awareness on the topic:

> There is no linear relationship between team size and output.

Team performance does not simply grow with each new member added. In fact, there may be a tipping point where adding another member even decreases overall performance.

**Limitations**. Brooks’ Law and the simulation cannot predict specific outcomes for every team. Even @Brooks1995 cautioned that this model is "outrageously simplified" [@Brooks1995, chapter 19]. Team performance involves complex interactions and cannot be captured in precise figures. Even if we were able to quantify each of the numerous variables (which we never can) the relationships between those variables are complex and convoluted. However, by examining team dynamics closely, we can draw valuable insights for decision-making and identify best practices in team management. Continue reading.




6. The law reduces team dynamics to pairwise relationships. If there was a problem, then Tom talks to Deborah, Deborah talks to Maria, and Maria talks to Tom. This way we have three conversations, each of them takes - let us say - 10 minutes. But what if the three come together and talk together? The threewise conversation may take longer then a pairwise one but it should be briefer than 30 minutes.



How productive a team is depends on many factors.

* Self-organising teams may need more time. In self-organisation some aspects that make the team are left to the team to work out by itself. That takes time. The idea is that self-organisation can lead to more effective team *in the long run*. Teams are not necessarily more effective in the sort run and teams are not necessarily more efficient. At least Scrum consistently highlights quality over quantity. [LIT]
* Let us not forget that it changes over time. A newly assembled team needs extra time. And every time the team setup changes, the team may need to renegotiate some rules. Even if the team configuration changes only for a few weeks (vacations, e.g.), the team may need to re-negotiate a few things.
* Meeting lateness alone can have a considerable impact. In the study by @Rogelberg2013 1/3 of the meetings did not start at the appointed time. Apart from numerous side effects, that can be a considerable loss of time.


Here are a few pointers:

* In one study, @Elsayed-Elkhouly1997 found that executives spend 30% of their time in meetings and 35% of it can be considered wasted. That makes around 10% of wasted time.
* In a scrum process the official recommendations for scrum meetings sum up to a percentage between `r ((20*0.25 + 1*8 + 0.5*8 + 3) )/(20*8) * 100`% and `r ((20*0.25 + 1*8 + 0.5*8 + 3 + 16) )/(20*8) * 100`% (incl. refinement meetings) [@Overeem2018; @Schwaber2020]. In my opinion, the real percentage is most likely lower, because to a degree these meetings serve productive purposes, as well, especially refinement and planning meetings.

The most important pointer that I can give you is your team colleagues' satisfaction on the job. If you want to know about inefficiencies, just talk to them.
